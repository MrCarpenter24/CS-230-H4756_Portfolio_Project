Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

My client, The Gaming Room, specified that they wanted to take their mobile app "Draw It or Lose It" to a web-based version that operates seamlessly across multiple platforms. The general concept was a game where players (divided into teams) had to guess what idea or item an image was mean to represent. The image is to be rendered slowly over the course of 30 seconds. If not guessed in time, the opposing team would be given the chance to guess - thus earning a point. This software would need a hosting back-end environment with consideration to network, memory, and storage usage with little consideration to processing due to the light demands of the game. Preferences for resource usage will still be taken into consideration for varying front-end clients, with seamless operation being the forefront of successful operation.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

There was a learning curve, yes. However, I feel that in the short period I had and while working a full-time job I was able to go from being a novice to presenting the work in this repository. My instructor, Dr. Lyon, was very patient and helpful during the process. I cannot credit myself with a thing without crediting her first. I feel that I did a great job understanding and presenting my understanding of how the various parts of a software design project (such as this one) interreact with each other. I was not working with individual pieces, no, but cogs as part of a whole machine. While the document is displayed in various sections and subsections, I have designed it so the reader can see how each component correlates to the other. Memory and storage management are two topics that I cover quite well in this manner.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Like my previous answer, I found it easier to design the components while understanding how they work together after going through, time and time again, the philosophy and general ideas behind the design. Documenting any sort of concept before making a proof of concept has proven helpful time and time again, though I am sure this does not apply to me solely.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I might combine the recommendations for memory and storage solutions into a single section. By dividing the ideas (of which are so closely related) I found that I had to be a bit repetitive or leave out detail in one section to be discussed further in the other. This created wordiness and caused the reader to work a bit harder to connect the dots between each section instead of having one smoothly flowing structure to follow.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are not my needs. I have to remember to detach what I would want from a piece of software from what the person or organization I am working for has specifically requested. While working on the documentation, I made the information more digestible than if I were handing it to a co-author or someone who works as a software designer. I feel as though the whole of the organization should be able to make sense of the documentation. That would explain my very explicit "Definitions" section for basic programming concepts. I also tried to tie in the specific use cases of those concepts in their definitions.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

As mentioned in the first question's response, this was a learning experience. I intend to take everything I have learned with me to the next software design project. I will revisit my understandings of the concepts I used, be it the delivery of the information in wording or format, maybe linking some scholarly papers in tandem with the types of articles I used, and hopefully find ways to make my learning more in-depth to present a more polished document next time. Perhaps next time the paper will have a more professional appeal that appears to be coming in the form of words with experience.
